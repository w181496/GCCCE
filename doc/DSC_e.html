<h3>GCCCE 2015 Doctoral Student Consortia</h3><h3>(Call for Papers)</h3>
</strong>
</center>
<br>
<p class="P3"> The DSC event aims to provide an opportunity for a selected number of PhD students to present, discuss and receive feedbacks on their dissertation work-in-progress from their peers and a panel of established researchers in the similar areas they are working. These consortia are meant for students to shape their research methodologies and analysis. As such, the student should not be too close to completing their research that the consortia would have little impact on their research work. Each accepted submission of the DSC will be published in the GCCCE 2015 Doctoral Student Consortium proceedings.</p>
<br>

<br><br>
<p>
	The Doctoral Student Consortia (DSC) are held in conjunction with GCCCE 2015 and is organized to bring together PhD students working in the areas of: 
</p>
<p>
C1：Science of Learning, Computer Supported Collaborative Learning, and Artificial Intelligence in Education
</p>
<p>
C2：Digital Classroom, Mobile and Ubiquitous Learning
</p>
<p>
C3：Joyful Learning and Society
</p>
<p>
C4：Technology in Higher Education and Human Performance
</p>
<p>
C5：Technology Enhanced Language Learning
</p>
<p>
C6：Teacher Professional Development, Policy, and Assessment of Learning
</p>
<p>
C7：Digital Technology, Innovation, and Education
</p>
<br><br>
<p><strong>Objectives</strong></p>
<p>
1. Provide feedback on participants’ current research approach and methodology;
</p>
<p>
	2. Provide guidance on future research directions;
</p>
<p>
3. Provide theme-based forums for discussing methodological and theoretical issues of central importance to different DSC themes;
</p>
<p>
4. Nurture a supportive learning community by promoting interaction between young researchers from various institutions and across different countries in the Asia-Pacific region and beyond.
</p>
